# ElasticTransformers
Semantic Elasticsearch with Sentence Transformers. We will use the power of Elastic and the magic of BERT to idnex a million articles and perform lexical and semantic search on them.  

The purpose is to provide an ease-of-use way of setting up your own Elasticsearch with near state of the art capabilities of contextual embeddings / semantic search using NLP transformers.  

## Overview
We will use the above to 
- Set up an Elasticsearch server with Dockers
- Collect A Million News Headlines
- Use sentence-transformers to index them onto Elastic (takes about 6 hrs on 2 CPU cores)
- Look at some comparison examples between lexical and semantic search

## Setup
### Set up your environment
My environment is called `et` and I use conda for this. Navigate inside the project directory
```
conda create --name et python=3.7  
conda install -n et nb_conda_kernels  
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Get the data
For this tutorial I am using [A Million News Headlines](https://www.kaggle.com/therohk/million-headlines "Kaggle A Million News Headlines") by Rohk and place it in the data folder inside the project dir.   

	    elastic_transformers/
	    ├── data/

You will find that the steps are otherwise pretty abstracted so you can also do this with your dataset of choice

### Elasticsearch with Docker
Follow the instructions on setting up Elastic with Docker from Elastic's page [here](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/docker.html)
For this tutorial, you only need to run the two steps:
 - [Pulling the image](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/docker.html#_pulling_the_image)
 - [Starting a single node cluster with Docker](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/docker.html#docker-cli-run-dev-mode)

## Features

This is an overview of the system setup

The repo introduces the ElasiticTransformers class. Utilities which help create, index and query Elasticsearch indices which include embeddings

```
# initiate the connection links as well as (optionally) the name of the index to work with
et=ElasticTransformers(url='http://localhost:9300',index_name='et-tiny')

# create_index_spec creates the specification for the index. Lists of relevant fields can be provided based on whether those would be needed for keyword search or semantic (dense vector) search. It also has parameters for the size of the dense vector as those can vary
et.create_index_spec(
    text_fields=['publish_date','headline_text'],
    dense_fields=['headline_text_embedding'],
    dense_fields_dim=768
)
# create_index - uses the spec created earlier to create an index ready for search
et.create_index()
# write_large_csv - breaks up a large csv file into chunks and iteratively uses a predefined embedding utility to create the embeddings list for each chunk and subsequently feed results to the index
et.write_large_csv('data/tiny_sample.csv',
                  chunksize=1000,
                  embedder=embed_wrapper,
                  field_to_embed='headline_text')
# search - allows to select either keyword (‘match’ in Elastic) or semantic (dense in Elastic) search. Notably it requires the same embedding function used in write_large_csv
et.search(query='search these terms',field='headline_text',type='match',embedder=embed_wrapper, size = 1000)
```

## Usage
After successful setup, use the folling notebooks to make this all work
